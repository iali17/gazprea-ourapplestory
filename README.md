# Usage
## Installing LLVM
In this assignment and your final project you will be working with LLVM. Due
to the complex nature (and size) of the project we did not want to include LLVM
as a subproject. Therefore, there is some additional setup required to get your
build up and running.

### On a personal machine
The first thing you should do is have a look into the `configureLLVM.sh` script
in the scripts folder and understand as much as possible. We'll touch some
things briefly here that are better explained there. The steps here will expect
you have some knowledge of what's going on inside the script.

  1. Checkout LLVM to a to your home directory from
     [OUR FORK](https://github.com/cmput415/llvm), checkout the 6.0.0 release,
     and change the directory in your script.
     1. `cd $HOME`
     1. `git clone git@github.com:cmput415/llvm.git`
     1. `cd llvm`
     1. `git checkout release_60`
  1. Add these configuration lines to your `~/.bashrc` on linux or
     `~/.bash_profile` on MacOS to setup the next steps. You should restart your
     terminal after editing these files.
      ```bash
      export LLVM_INS="$HOME/llvm-ins/" # Change me if you really want.
      export LLVM_DIR="$LLVM_INS/lib/cmake/llvm/" # Don't change me.
      export PATH="$LLVM_INS/bin:$PATH" # Don't change me
      ```
  1. Point the build script at your source directory. If aren't customizing your
     build and downloaded at llvm at `$HOME/llvm` you can skip this.
     1. In `configureLLVM.sh` change `SRC_DIR` to the path to the llvm
        directory.
  1. Pick your build directory. The default is a subdirectory of the source
     directory (an acceptable solution if you want to just skip this). Remember
     this for later either way.
     1. In `configureLLVM.sh` change `BLD_DIR` to your preferred build
        directory.
  1. DO NOT CHANGE THE INSTALL DIRECTORY VARIABLE.
  1. Choose your build type. The default (`Release`) is already uncommented.
     If you want to change it then you should comment the `Release` line and
     uncomment another line.
  1. Run `configureLLVM.sh`.
  1. `cd <build_directory>` where `<build_directory>` is the path you chose
     earlier (`$LLVM_INS/build` if you did not change it).
  1. `make -j x` where x is the number of compilation threads. `4` is safe if
     you have >= 8gb RAM. Haven't experimented much here. The script is set up
     to try to use a better linker, but if you end up with your system linker
     the memory usage can balloon quickly and paging can become a problem. If
     you're having problems with hanging or system lag while compiling you
     might want to kill this (you won't lose your progress if `ctrl+c` works)
     and run with less threads.
  1. Run `make install`.
  1. CMake should automatically pick up your built llvm now. You should return
     to the assignment specification to complete setup.

### On university machines
You won't be building LLVM on the university machines: AICT wouldn't be very
happy with you. Instead, we are providing a **RELEASE** build available for
everyone.
  1. Follow the instructions on the [setup
     page](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~c415/setup/) for the CS computers and
     LLVM will be available to you.

## Building
### Linux
  1. Install git, java (only the runtime is necessary), and cmake (>= v3.0).
     - Until now, cmake has found the dependencies without issues. If you
       encounter an issue, let Braedy know and we can fix it.
  1. Make a directory that you intend to build the project in and change into
     that directory.
  1. Run `cmake <path-to-VCalc-Base>`.
  1. Run `make`.
  1. Done.

## Pulling in upstream changes
If there are updates to your assignment you can retrieve them using the
instructions here.
  1. Add the upstream as a remote using `git remote add upstream <clone-link>`.
  1. Fetch updates from the upstream using `git fetch upstream`
  1. Merge the updates into a local branch using
     `git merge <local branch> upstream/<upstream branch>`. Usually both
     branches are `master`.
  1. Make sure that everything builds before committing to your personal
     master! It's much easier to try again if you can make a fresh clone
     without the merge!

Once the remote has been added, future updates are simply the `fetch` and
`merge` steps.
